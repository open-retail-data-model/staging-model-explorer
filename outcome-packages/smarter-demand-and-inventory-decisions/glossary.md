## Demand planning terms

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Planning unit | The atomic entity for forecasting; may be store×SKU or a rolled-up IBP grain |
| FVA (Forecast Value Added) | Improvement of the statistical forecast over a naïve baseline after planner enrichment |
| Forecast bias | Systematic over- or under-forecasting; positive bias implies excess inventory |
| DNA of demand | Decomposition of forecast into base, promo, price, weather, holiday, and residual drivers |

## Inventory terms

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Days of supply (DoS) | On-hand units divided by average daily sales |
| Safety stock | Buffer inventory to absorb demand and lead-time variability; sized as `z × √(LT·σ_d² + D²·σ_LT²)` |
| Reorder point (ROP) | Inventory level that triggers a replenishment order; `lead-time demand + safety stock` |
| ABC/XYZ | Volume tier (ABC) × demand variability (XYZ) segmentation matrix |
| Cycle service level (Type I / α) | Probability of no stockout in a replenishment cycle; maps directly to the safety-stock z-score |
| Fill rate (Type II / β) | Fraction of demand met from stock; requires the unit-normal loss function to size, not just a z-score |
| GMROI | Gross Margin Return On Inventory investment = gross margin ÷ average inventory cost |
| Weeks of cover (WOC) | On-hand units divided by average weekly sell rate |
| Sell-through | Units sold ÷ (units sold + units on hand) over a period |

## Out-of-stocks terms

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| OOS rate | Percentage of product×store×day records with a stockout |
| Lost sales | Demand not captured in POS sales due to stockout |
| Demand sensing | Short-horizon anomaly detection bridging the forecast lag blind spot |
| Preventable OOS | Stockout that could have been avoided given policy and supply context |
| Phantom stock / record inaccuracy | System on-hand > 0 but the shelf is empty; a dominant real-world OOS driver (`oos_cause` values `phantom_stock`, `record_inaccuracy`, `shrinkage`, `misplaced`) |
| Lost margin | Estimated gross margin (not revenue) foregone during a stockout; the correct basis for recovery prioritization |
