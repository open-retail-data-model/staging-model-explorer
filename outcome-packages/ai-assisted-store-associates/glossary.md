# AI-Assisted Store Associates — Business Glossary

> Status: 🟡 In progress (0.1-beta) · Last reviewed: 2026-08-29

Vendor-neutral; follows the ORDM [data model standards](../../docs/data-model-standards.md). This package covers two capabilities on one schema. The **Next Best Action (NBA)** engine for the store floor: it normalizes disparate real-time triggers into
a single prioritized task queue routed to the right associate, then closes the loop by capturing the
response and the real-world outcome. It **builds on** the canonical core rather than redefining it — customer,
product, and store context are foreign keys into `customer.profile` / `product.product` / `store.store`, and
the trigger signals map to existing entities (see *Builds on* in the README).

The second capability, **Real-Time Data Access**, is the governed lookup contract the associate device reads (inventory, price/promotion, order status, operational context, and a freshness surface). The two share this schema and the canonical core but carry no foreign keys into each other, so either deploys without the other.

## Use-case status

| Use case | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Real-Time Data Access | done | Governed associate lookup contract. |
| Associates Best Next Actions | in-progress | Prioritized action queue (`gold_associate_action_queue_current`). |
| Digital Assistant Selling Tools | in-progress | Response + outcome loop (`gold_action_outcome_funnel_daily`). |

## Tables & views

| Object | Grain | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `associate` | One row per associate per SCD2 version | Store-workforce dimension: role, skills, home store, employment type. Master-tagged extension; no raw employee PII. Live floor status/zone is out of scope (operational state). |
| `suggested_action` | One append-only row per action generated | The normalized, prioritized NBA queue routed to associates, recorded as generated and never restated (no mutable workflow state, §0). The action's lifecycle lives in `action_response_log`; `priority_score` is the score at generation and is time-decayed downstream in the queue view. Adopter-owned; schema + DQ contract. |
| `action_response_log` | One row per associate response event | Append-only log of how the associate acted on a prompt (accept/reject/defer/complete/expire) — the authoritative lifecycle of a suggested action. |
| `outcome_resolution` | One row per resolved action | Append-only real-world outcome (sale closed, item restocked, …) — the ROI signal and labeled training history. |
| `gold_associate_action_queue_current` | One row per open, non-expired action | The live prioritized queue an associate sees, ranked within associate by the time-decayed `current_priority_score`. "Open" and `current_state` are derived from `action_response_log` (no terminal response yet), not a stored status. |
| `gold_action_outcome_funnel_daily` | One row per store × zone × associate × trading date × action_type | Generated / accepted / rejected / completed / expired counts (from the response log), acceptance & completion rates, avg response time, realized outcome value. The associate and zone grain serve per-associate effectiveness and the per-zone staffing signal. |
| `mv_associate_action_performance` | store × zone × associate × trading date × action_type | UC Metric View over the daily funnel: acceptance, completion, responsiveness, realized value (ratio-of-sums), broken down by associate or zone. |
| `associate_context_event` | One source event (append-only) | Streaming-ready change events for inventory, price, promotion, order, operations. |
| `associate_fulfillment_status` | One order (current) | Associate-safe BOPIS/curbside/fulfillment status. No customer PII. |
| `associate_lookup_audit` | One lookup | Allow/deny audit with hashed entity keys and latency. |
| `gold_associate_product_inventory_current` | product × store | On-hand / ATS / stock status / nearby alternative / freshness, with honest basis fields. |
| `gold_associate_price_promotion_current` | product × store | Base and effective price, active store-scoped promo, eligibility flags. |
| `gold_associate_order_status_current` | order | Fulfillment type, status, pickup readiness, exception, freshness. |
| `gold_associate_operational_context_current` | store × context | Replenishment tasks and equipment alerts safe for associates. |
| `gold_associate_data_freshness` | feed × store | Lag, freshness status, SLA state. |
| `profile` / `product` / `store` | — | *(canonical-core)* the customer / product / store context the actions reference. |
## Key concepts

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Next Best Action (NBA)** | The single highest-value task an associate should do right now, chosen by normalizing every trigger into one queue and ranking by a unified score. |
| **Business Value Score** (`priority_score`) | A dynamic 0–100 value the associate UI sorts on: `base_score` × dynamic multipliers, then time-decayed. Lets fundamentally different tasks (help a VIP vs. restock a shelf) be ranked against each other. |
| **Base score (hierarchy of needs)** | The priority in a vacuum before context: safety_loss_prevention 90, bopis_fulfill 75 (SLA-driven), customer_assist 60, restock_shelf / merchandising 40, maintenance_cleaning 20. |
| **Dynamic multipliers** | Contextual scaling applied to the base: customer VIP ×1.5 (unknown ×1.0); high-margin product ×1.4 (low-margin ×0.8); completely empty shelf ×2.0 (low stock ×1.1). *Example:* an unknown shopper dwelling at high-margin OLED TVs (60 × 1.4 = **84**) outranks an empty shelf of HDMI cables (40 × 0.9 × 2.0 = **72**). |
| **`decay_type` — linear** | Persistent-state tasks (restocking, cleaning): the physical state won't self-resolve, so priority erodes slowly. `priority_score = base_score − (elapsed_minutes × 0.5)`, to a floor. |
| **`decay_type` — exponential** | Transient tasks (customer assistance, queue-busting): the opportunity window closes fast. `priority_score = base_score × (0.8 ^ elapsed_minutes)` — a VIP assist at 85 falls below routine restocking within ~5 minutes. |
| **`decay_type` — immediate_nullification** | A secondary event makes the task instantly irrelevant: the customer leaves the zone, another associate scans the out-of-stock item, or the store closes. The engine logs an `expired` response in `action_response_log`, which drops the action from the open queue. |
| **`context_payload`** | Schemaless JSON the associate app renders, so a new task type needs no schema migration. Common shapes below. |
| **Acceptance rate / completion rate** | `actions_accepted / actions_generated` and `actions_completed / actions_generated`. A run of `rejected | too_busy` in one zone is a staffing signal, not just a data point. |

## Metrics (definitions)

Captured engine-neutrally (definition, grain, expression) and materialized as the UC Metric View
`mv_associate_action_performance`. Rates are **ratio-of-sums** so they re-aggregate at any grain.

| Metric | Definition | Grain / dimensions | Expression (over the gold funnel) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `actions_generated` | Count of NBAs dispatched. | store × zone × associate × date × action_type | `SUM(actions_generated)` |
| `acceptance_rate` | Share of generated actions accepted. | store × zone × associate × date × action_type | `SUM(actions_accepted) / SUM(actions_generated)` |
| `completion_rate` | Share of generated actions completed. | store × zone × associate × date × action_type | `SUM(actions_completed) / SUM(actions_generated)` |
| `avg_response_seconds` | Mean dispatch-to-first-response time. | store × zone × associate × date × action_type | `SUM(response_seconds_total) / SUM(responses_timed)` |
| `sales_closed` | Actions resolved as a closed sale. | store × zone × associate × date × action_type | `SUM(sales_closed)` |
| `realized_outcome_value` | Monetary value attributed to actions. | store × zone × associate × date × action_type | `SUM(realized_outcome_value)` (single reporting currency) |
## Standards used

| Concept | Standard |
|---|---|
| Dates / timestamps | ISO 8601 (UTC) |
| Currency | ISO 4217 (`currency_code`, `outcome_currency_code`) |
| Money typing | DECIMAL(18,2) for `outcome_value_amount` (ORDM §A.6) |
## Terms — Real-Time Data Access

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Available to sell (ATS)** | On-hand minus reserved, floored at zero. |
| **Stock status** | `IN_STOCK`, `LOW_STOCK`, `OUT_OF_STOCK`, or `UNKNOWN`. |
| **Inventory basis** | `daily_snapshot` (EOD `inventory_position` only) or `event_overlay` (intra-day event present). |
| **Freshness status (event overlay)** | `fresh` (&lt;60 min lag), `delayed` (60–1440), `stale` (&gt;1440), or `UNKNOWN`. |
| **Freshness status (daily snapshot)** | Calendar age of `snapshot_date_key`: same day → `fresh` (**EOD semantics, not live shelf**), 1 day behind → `delayed`, older → `stale`. |
| **Location basis** | `event_location_code` when a free-text code exists; `not_modeled` when absent. ORDM has no shelf/bay geo. |
| **Nearby-store match basis** | `same_region_on_hand` — same `store.region`, active, on-hand &gt; 0; **not** distance-ranked. |
| **Customer eligibility status** | Always `CUSTOMER_ELIGIBILITY_REQUIRES_AUTHORIZED_CONTEXT` in associate gold — personalized offers are not inferred. |
| **Store-scope authorization** | Associate may only read data for stores in their authorized set unless holding a cross-store role. |
| **Exact product match** | Lookup by durable `product_id` / SKU / GTIN equality — free-text fuzzy search is denied at the policy layer. |
| **Associate-safe order status** | Fulfillment fields without profile, contact, loyalty, or payment attributes. |
## Classification

| Class | Examples |
|---|---|
| `public_ops` | Store name, product name, stock status |
| `associate_ops` | Quantities, pickup desk codes, equipment zone alerts |
| `restricted` | Customer PII, unit cost, margin, loss-prevention — **excluded** from gold |
## Deferred (documented, not built)

A normalized `associate_skill` association (skills are a delimited STRING today); a live associate
availability/roster fact (floor status/zone is operational state the app owns); an ML expected-value model
trained on `outcome_resolution` (this package ships the labeled history, not the model); and a UC Governed
Tag overlay for the workforce dimension. Trigger ingestion (sensor / POS / digital) is out of scope — those
signals live in connected-store-signals, `transaction.sales`, and `interaction.touchpoint`.
